## Description

This is a simple React application titled "User Inventory" that allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of users. The application also implements pagination, limiting 6 user cards per page. It uses SASS for styling and localStorage for data storage. Additionally, React Redux is used for state management.


## Usage
**Adding a New User**

- Click the "Add User" button.
- Fill out the user information in the form that appears.
- Click the "Submit" button to add the new user to the inventory.
**Editing a User**
- Click the "Edit" button on the user card you want to edit.
Update the user information in the form.
- Click the "Submit" button to save the changes.
**Deleting a User**
- Click the "Delete" button on the user card you want to delete.

**Viewing Users**
- Click the "View" button on the user card you want to delete.

**Pagination**
- Pagination is implemented to limit 6 user cards per page. You can use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate between pages.

**Styling**
- The application uses SASS for styling.

**State Management**
- React Redux is used for state management. The state is managed in a Redux store, and actions and reducers are defined to handle CRUD operations on the user data.

**LocalStorage**
- The application uses localStorage to store user data persistently. This means that even if you close and reopen the application, the user data will still be available.
